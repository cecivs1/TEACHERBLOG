                    <p class="text_muted">¡Disneyland is a magical place! If you are a Disney fan such as me I would recommend you to take a trip to Orlando and get to know it.
                      I would recommend to visit all Parks and to spend at least one week in Orlando so you can get to know different places also.
                      I was there with my family for the holidays and we spend New Year's eve in Epcot, we spend such a good time enjoying the different shows and restaurants.
                      My favorite park was Magic Kingdom, it reminded me when I was a little girl whenever I saw the princesses shows and attractions.
                      I would recommend you to take a family trip there so you can make such a good memories and have a quality time.
                      Here is a photo of my family, my dad is missing because he took the photo, maybe I'll update it later...

                    <p class="text_muted">I love the culture, the people and the language. If you are a fan of art, you must go on a trip to Italy.
                      I was there for an internship during the summer of 2019, I used to work for a marketing company near Naples so I got to enjoy the Napoletanian food which is amazing and I also had plenty of time to discover Italy during the weekends.
                      I would recommend to take a long trip there, at least 2 weeks because Italy has so much to offer. 
                      Must visited places I recommend are: Milano, Venezia, Siena, Florence, Rome and the south (it is beautiful).

              <h5 class="text_success">I visited New York in june 2016</h5>
              <p class="text_muted">New York became one of my favorite places. The city always have something to do, there are so many activities and places you can visit.
                My favorite spots were: The Public Library, Moma museum, Chelsea Market, Central Park and Blue Note.
                I would recommend to stay in Manhattan because you can walk anywhere or just take the subway.
                Also, if you are a photography fan such as me I would recommend you to grab your camera and just walk on the street and find inspiration on it, I'm sure that you will find a lot of things
                and spots to capture.

                        <p>In a dystopian near-future Japan, an influenza virus spreads throughout the canine population, with a risk of crossing to humans. The 6-term authoritarian mayor of Megasaki City, Kenji Kobayashi, signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure for the dog flu. The first dog to be exiled is Spots, a white and black-speckled pink-nosed dog who served as the bodyguard of Atari Kobayashi, the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor. Six months later, Atari steals a plane and flies to Trash Island to search for Spots. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a pack of dogs led by a seemingly black dog named Chief, who is a former stray. The pack decides to help Atari locate Spots, although Chief refuses to join because of his inability to fraternize with humans. Together, they fend off a rescue team accompanied by a robot dog that Kobayashi sent to retrieve Atari.</p>
